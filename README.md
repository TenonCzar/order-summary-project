Order summary card using HTML &amp; CSS
While writing down the code as a newbie I had issues with the background changing, shadow blending and image resizing. But as I moved on with the code I got more exposed with my CSS  and understood more things.

I'm wasn't sure of the **content** selector so I made the background responsive to change once it get's to the wider screen range.
Another issue I had while going on this project was width sizing which is mostly a problem to every newbie programmer. But I tried using the % value and it worked even for the image and other item.

After coding I actually asked if I was the one who did some stuff like this. But well it was me and no one else.

To conclude I'll say as you code, find joy in what you're doing and trace your mistakes before submitting any projects, so as to get the best out of the codes.

Happy Coding Guysâœ…ðŸš€
